TheConery Color Scheme for Sublime Text 2

Color Scheme for Sublime Text 2 inspired by Rob Conery's Visual Studio port of famous TextMate theme Vibrant Ink.

This is very much a work in progress as I try to figure out the different ways Sublime handles coloring text. Screenshot coming once I have it in better shape.
